🚀 Day 4 of Java Framework Learning – Introduction to Singleton Design Pattern

🌱 What is the Singleton Design Pattern?
Singleton Design Pattern ensures a class has only one instance throughout the application and provides a global point of access to it. It restricts instantiation so no other objects can be created, making it useful for managing shared resources.

💡 Benefits of Singleton (vs Regular Class Instantiation):
🔸 Single shared instance avoids resource wastage.
🔸 Provides a centralized access point for the shared resource.
🔸 Ensures consistency and state management across the app.
🔸 Helps maintain thread safety in concurrent environments.

⚙️ Where is Singleton Used?
Commonly used for:
🔸 Configuration managers where only one config object should exist.
🔸 Logging systems to handle logs in a unified way.
🔸 Database connection pools to manage connections effectively.
🔸 Caching systems for consistent cache management.

📘 Today’s Practice Code (Singleton Pattern in Java):
Practiced a simple example demonstrating Singleton concept:
🔸 Created a Singleton class with private constructor and static getInstance() method.
🔸 Verified that multiple calls to getInstance() return the same object reference.
🔸 Compared with regular classes where new objects are created for each construction call.
🔸 Key Singleton implementations summarized:
 - Regular Class: Each new call creates a new, independent object.
 - Basic Singleton (Eager): Single instance created when class loads.
 - Thread-Safe Singleton (Lazy): Instance created when needed, with synchronized thread safety.
 - Inner Class Singleton (Bill Pugh): Uses static inner class for efficient, thread-safe lazy initialization.

👉 This clearly showed how Singleton restricts object creation ensuring single instance usage across the app.

🧩 Key Takeaways from Today’s Practice:
🔹 Singleton ensures only one instance of a class exists.
🔹 Useful for managing shared resources consistently.
🔹 Modern implementations also handle thread safety for concurrency.
🔹 Core principle for designing robust, resource-efficient applications.
